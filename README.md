# Guest List App 

A simple Nodejs application making a List of the guest that are about (or not!) to come to your party. Nothing fancy in terms of UI but very functional. 
Used Nodejs body-parser to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware so that we have some kind of validation. Since it supports only single body-requests it is perfectly fine for this project. 
It is written in typescript since it is becoming my go-to lang ... :O 
Cheers!
